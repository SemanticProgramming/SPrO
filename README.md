# Semantic Programming Ontology (SPrO)
(version 0.2 beta)

We develop a Semantic Programming Ontology (SPrO) that is used like a semantic programming language. It consists of 
specific classes, individuals and properties that represent commands and variables that serve as an ontology-based 
and thus semantic programming language. SPrO can be used to describe the graphical user interface (GUI), data representations, 
user interactions, and all workflow processes of a semantic WCMS. The descriptions are written in a corresponding source code
ontology. A Java-based middleware functions as a compiler that dynamically executes the descriptions in this source code
ontology by interpreting them as declarative specifications. 

Further information on the project is available at http://escience.biowikifarm.net - feel free to contact us at 
dev@morphdbase.de

This repository contains the Semantic Programming Ontology (SPrO) and the code for the Java-based middleware, which 
interprets the descriptions in the source code ontology based on the commands and variables from SPrO and provides 
communication via a websocket between the ontologies and the frontend - the AngularJS based frontend providing the 
user interface

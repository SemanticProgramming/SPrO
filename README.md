# Semantic Programming Ontology (SPrO)
(version 0.2 beta)

We develop a Semantic Programming Ontology (SPrO) that is used for software programming. SPrO can be used like a programming language with which one can control a data-centric Semantic Web application by describing it within a corresponding source code ontology. SPrO consists of ontology classes, individuals and properties that the accompanying Java-based middleware (see https://github.com/SemanticProgramming/Interpreter) interprets as commands and variables. The commands are defined as annotation properties. Specific values and variable-carrying resources are defined as ontology individuals. Additional object properties are used to specify relations between resources, and data properties are used for specifying numerical values or literals for resources that describe the Semantic Web application. SPrO can be used to describe the graphical user interface (GUI), data representations, user interactions, and all workflow processes of a Semantic Web application. The descriptions are written in a corresponding source code ontology. The Java-based middleware functions as an interpreter that dynamically interprets and executes the descriptions in this source code ontology by interpreting them as declarative specifications.

This repository contains the Semantic Programming Ontology (SPrO). With it you can specify source code ontologies for your Semantic Web application. In order to execute these source code ontologies you also need the interpreter (https://github.com/SemanticProgramming/Interpreter) and the interface (https://github.com/SemanticProgramming/Interface). Basic functionalities are described in the SOCCOMAS source code ontology (SC-Basic; https://github.com/SemanticProgramming/SOCCOMAS) and can be re-used for your Semantic Web application.

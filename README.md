# Semantic Programming Ontology (SPrO)
(version 0.2 beta)

We develop a Semantic Programming Ontology (SPrO) that is used for software programming. SPrO can be used like a programming language with which one can control a semantic web content management system (S-WCMS) by describing it within a corresponding source code ontology. SPrO consists of ontology classes, individuals and properties that the accompanying Java middleware interprets as commands and variables. The commands are defined as annotation properties. Specific values and variable-carrying resources are defined as ontology individuals. Additional object properties are used to specify relations between resources, and data properties are used for specifying numerical values or literals for resources that describe the S-WCMS. SPrO can be used to describe the graphical user interface (GUI), data representations, user interactions, and all workflow processes of a S-WCMS. The descriptions are written in a corresponding source code ontology. A Java-based middleware functions as a compiler that dynamically executes the descriptions in this source code ontology by interpreting them as declarative specifications.

This repository contains the Semantic Programming Ontology (SPrO) and the code for the Java-based middleware, which 
interprets the descriptions in the source code ontology based on the commands and variables from SPrO and provides 
communication via a websocket between the ontologies and the frontend - the AngularJS based frontend providing the 
user interface
